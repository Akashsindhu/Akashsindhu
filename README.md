### I am Machine learning enthusiast with an interest in Data Science, End-to-End Deep learning, and MLOps.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on publishing more MLOps (fully end-to-end) projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flask, Nginx, Gunicorn.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects related to Deep learning.
